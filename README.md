Many large organizations have compliance divisions that help them to be consistent
with the legal regulations that enforce some elements of ethical behavior, such
as not accepting gifts above a certain value. The Code, however, encompasses
a much larger realm of behaviors promoting positive action for all stakeholders.
An organization-wide effort to follow the aspirations and guidelines of the Code
benefits any size company and benefits the citizens and society they serve
